## Description

This study guide was built to provide a location to collect information on how to use CSS, JavaScript, Git, and HTML. The study guide will allow students to access the information so that they can study and refer back to when trying to solve problems in their code. Creating this project exposed me to the basics of the coding languages it is a guide for and gave me a background to start building more complex programs.
